- 👋 Hi, I’m Robert "Pito" Sanchez
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a Data Scientist
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, HTML, SQL - and I'm also planning to learn Machine Learning and AI - and anything else that will make me a good coder.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project that I can also learn the intricacies of coding.  At this early stage I am willing to take part in anything where I will not only get the necessary experience but also learn.  
- 📫 You can reach me at robsanchez124@gmail.com.  Please feel free to contact me at your convenience.  Thank you for your time and interest.
