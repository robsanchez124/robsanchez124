- 👋 Hi, I’m Robert "Pito" Sanchez
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a Software Engineer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, HTML, SQL, JavaScript, CSS, NodeJS in other languages in hopes to be a good engineer.    
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project that I can also learn the intricacies of coding.  At this early stage I am willing to take part in anything where I will not only get the necessary experience but also learn.  
- 📫 You can reach me at robsanchez124@gmail.com.  Please feel free to contact me at your convenience.  Thank you for your time and interest.
- As I gain more experience from my studies and challenges, I will post more projects to illustrate my skills.
